# FM-Radio-Transmitter 


# Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an FM radio transmitter using resistors, capacitors, an inductor, and a transistor on a breadboard. The circuit converts audio signals into FM radio waves, which are then broadcasted at a resonant frequency. A wire serves as the antenna, and an aux cable allows users to select the audio source.

The transmitter enables the playback of music or podcasts through car speakers in older vehicles without Bluetooth functionality, providing a simple and cost-effective alternative for modern audio integration.

# How to Use
Connect an aux cable to the audio source (e.g., smartphone, MP3 player).
Power the circuit with a suitable power supply.
Tune a standard FM radio to the transmitter's frequency (within 88–108 MHz).
Enjoy streaming your favorite music or podcasts!
