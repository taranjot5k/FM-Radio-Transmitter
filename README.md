#FM-Radio-Transmitter
Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an FM radio transmitter using resistors, capacitors, an inductor, and a transistor on a breadboard. The circuit converts audio signals into FM radio waves, which are then broadcasted at a resonant frequency. A wire serves as the antenna, and an aux cable allows users to select the audio source.

The transmitter enables the playback of music or podcasts through car speakers in older vehicles without Bluetooth functionality, providing a simple and cost-effective alternative for modern audio integration.

Project Goals
Successfully broadcast songs using the FM transmitter circuit, playable on a standard FM radio.
Provide a practical solution for streaming music or podcasts in cars and other systems without Bluetooth connectivity.
Enhance understanding of circuit design, BJTs, and the principles of FM transmission.
Features
FM Frequency Range: Transmits within the standard FM frequency band of 88–108 MHz.
Portability: Compact and easy to integrate into existing systems.
Practical Application: Ideal for cars and speakers lacking modern connectivity options.


Lessons Learned
Amplification and Signal Behavior: Gained insights into how small signals are emitted and influenced by circuit components.
Problem-Solving: Resolved challenges in matching expected and actual frequencies by fine-tuning components, especially inductors.
Iterative Design: Improved the circuit through testing and by substituting components with better-suited counterparts.
Future Potential
This project has the potential to evolve into a marketable product:

How to Use
Connect an aux cable to the audio source (e.g., smartphone, MP3 player).
Power the circuit with a suitable power supply.
Tune a standard FM radio to the transmitter's frequency (within 88–108 MHz).
Enjoy streaming your favorite music or podcasts!
